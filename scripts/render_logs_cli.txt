The professions are taken randomly from a corpus. There are 7 templates of different interactions in everyday situations. Three different variations of the same prompt using a different pronoun (she/he/they) are put into ChatGPT. The model is asked a simple question about the interaction, of which there is a “correct” answer based on common sense. The percentage of incorrect responses and the number of inconsistent answers across the three variations are recorded. To analyze narrative generation, ChatGPT is prompted to write a story of a character given their profession and the authors recorded the gender ChatGPT assigns that character based on their name.',

Similarly, there was the possibility of limitations arising from names that may not be associated  with a specific gender that could be explored.

Standard ANNs are trained through backpropagation, which involves calculating the error with respect to weights, and updating the weights to decrease this error. Mathematically, backpropagation involves finding the derivative of the loss to update the weights. This cannot be applied to the concept of spikes, which are constant values of 1s and 0s, as the derivative of any constant is 0. While there may exist workarounds, they may not be faster in terms of training a model than an ANN. Regardless, this would be an interesting concept to explore, and the discovery of a workaround that is potentially faster than backpropagation would open the possibilities of applying SNNs at a larger scale.

2025-04-06 21:32:37      response: 'One limitation with SNNs that I see, which may be a commonly pointed out fault, is difficulty in training a SNN model. Standard ANNs are trained through backpropagation, which involves calculating the error with respect to weights, and updating the weights to decrease this error. Mathematically, backpropagation involves finding the derivative of the loss to update the weights. This cannot be applied to the concept of spikes, which are constant values of 1s and 0s, as the derivative of any constant is 0. While there may exist workarounds, they may not be faster in terms of training a model than an ANN. Regardless, this would be an interesting concept to explore, and the discovery of a workaround that is potentially faster than backpropagation would open the possibilities of applying SNNs at a larger scale.',

By prioritizing breadth-first discussions (covering multiple papers per session), student agency (allowing participants to drive topics), and purpose-driven themes, they show how lightweight, low-commitment groups serve as entry points to research labs.
